## ✨ Description

**Flow Manager 2025** is a web platform designed to help teams and organizations efficiently manage, automate, and monitor their internal workflows and business processes.

The application allows users to design custom flows and templates, manage teams and users, and automate the review and approval of submitted forms. It facilitates collaboration by providing a unified dashboard for all process participants, ensuring transparency and accountability at every stage.

### Key Features

- **Teams and Users Visualization:** View and organize all teams and users within the organization.
- **Flow & Template Creation:** Admins can create reusable flows and templates tailored to specific business processes.
- **Form Submission & Flow Execution:** Users fill out forms that move through a defined flow. Each submission can be reviewed, accepted, or rejected according to the flow logic.
- **Progress Tracking:** Real-time status updates for all active flows and submissions.
- **Role-based Access:** Secure, detailed permissions for users and teams.

Built with a modern tech stack (.NET 9, Blazor WebAssembly, SQLite), Flow Manager 2025 is fast, scalable, and easy to deploy via Docker in any environment.

## 🐳 Docker Usage

Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed.

### Run the application locally with Docker

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dezGusty/flow-manager-25.git
   cd flow-manager-25
   ```

2. **Pull the docker images:**
   ```bash
   docker pull stancunicol/flowmanager:api-latest
   docker pull stancunicol/flowmanager:client-latest
   ```

3. **Create a docker-compose.yml in the project root:**
   ```bash
   services:
   api:
    image: stancunicol/flowmanager:api-latest
    container_name: flowmanager-api
    ports:
      - "5000:8080"

   client:
    image: stancunicol/flowmanager:client-latest
    container_name: flowmanager-client
    ports:
      - "3000:80"
    environment:
      - API_URL=http://api:80
    depends_on:
      - api
   ```

4. **Run the app:**
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   For the app to stop:
   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

### Publish and update image to Docker Hub

Replace `<your_dockerhub_username>` with your Docker Hub account.

```bash
docker build -t <your_dockerhub_username>/flow-manager-2025:latest .
docker login
docker push <your_dockerhub_username>/flow-manager-2025:latest
```

#### If you update the image:

1. Build the new image:
   ```bash
   docker build -t <your_dockerhub_username>/flow-manager-2025:latest .
   ```
2. Push to Docker Hub:
   ```bash
   docker push <your_dockerhub_username>/flow-manager-2025:latest
   ```

## 🛠️ Development Instructions

1. Open the project in Visual Studio 2022+.
2. Go to **Configure Startup Project...** (right click on the solution, or from the top menu).
3. For each component project (FlowManager.API and FlowManager.Client):
    - Select **Action: Start**
    - Select **Debug Target: https**
    - Always run with **New Profile** (create a new profile for each debug session).

## 📝 Additional Notes

- **DB Setup:** The SQLite database file (`flowmanager.db`) is automatically created at first run.
- **Extensibility:** The modular structure allows for rapid addition of new features, integration of new services, or changing the database.
