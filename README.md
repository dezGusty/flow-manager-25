## ✨ Description

**Flow Manager 2025** is a web platform designed to help teams and organizations efficiently manage, automate, and monitor their internal workflows and business processes.

The application allows users to design custom flows and templates, manage teams and users, and automate the review and approval of submitted forms. It facilitates collaboration by providing a unified dashboard for all process participants, ensuring transparency and accountability at every stage.

### Key Features

- **Teams and Users Visualization:** View and organize all teams and users within the organization.
- **Flow & Template Creation:** Admins can create reusable flows and templates tailored to specific business processes.
- **Form Submission & Flow Execution:** Users fill out forms that move through a defined flow. Each submission can be reviewed, accepted, or rejected according to the flow logic.
- **Progress Tracking:** Real-time status updates for all active flows and submissions.
- **Role-based Access:** Secure, detailed permissions for users and teams.

Built with a modern tech stack (.NET 9, Blazor WebAssembly, SQLite), Flow Manager 2025 is fast, scalable, and easy to deploy via Docker in any environment.

## 🐳 Docker Usage

Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed and running while doing this process.

### Run the application locally with Docker

1. **Clone the repo:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/dezGusty/flow-manager-25.git
   cd flow-manager-25
   ```

2. **Pull the docker images:**

   ```bash
   docker pull triodor/flowmanager:api-latest
   docker pull stancunicol/flowmanager:client-latest
   ```

3. **Navigate to the FlowManager folder:**

   ```bash
   cd FlowManager
   ```

   **Ensure your `docker-compose.yml` contains:**

   ```yaml
   services:
     api:
       image: triodor/flowmanager:api-latest
       container_name: flowmanager-api
       ports:
         - "5000:8080"
       volumes:
         - flowmanager-data:/app/data
       environment:
         - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production
       restart: unless-stopped

     client:
       image: stancunicol/flowmanager:client-latest
       container_name: flowmanager-client
       ports:
         - "3000:80"
       environment:
         - API_URL=http://api:80
       depends_on:
         - api
       restart: unless-stopped

   volumes:
     flowmanager-data:
       driver: local
   ```

4. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   ```

   The database will be automatically initialized with migrations and seed data on first run.

5. **Access the application:**
   - **Client UI:** http://localhost:3000
   - **API:** http://localhost:5000

6. **Login with default credentials:**
   - **Admin:** `admin.user@simulator.com` / `admin123`
   - **Moderator:** `moderator.user@simulator.com` / `moderator123`
   - **Basic User:** `basic.user@simulator.com` / `basic123`

7. **Stop the application:**

   ```bash
   docker compose down
   ```

   > **Note:** The database is persisted in a Docker volume named `flowmanager-data`, so your data will remain even after stopping the containers.

### How It Works Across Devices

The Docker setup is designed to work consistently on any device:

- **Database Initialization:** On first run, the API automatically creates the SQLite database, applies all migrations, and seeds initial data (admin, moderator, and basic users). No manual database setup needed.
- **Data Persistence:** The database is stored in a Docker volume (`flowmanager-data`), which persists even when containers are stopped or removed.
- **Cross-Platform:** Docker images work on Windows, macOS, and Linux without modification.
- **No Local Dependencies:** Everything runs in containers - no need to install .NET, SQLite, or other dependencies on your machine.

Anyone can clone the repo, run `docker compose up -d`, and have a fully working application with pre-populated test users in seconds!

### Troubleshooting

- **Database initialization issues:** If you see "no such table" errors, the database volume may be corrupted. Remove it and restart:

  ```bash
  docker compose down
  docker volume rm flowmanager-data
  docker compose up -d
  ```

- **Port conflicts:** If ports 3000 or 5000 are already in use, modify the port mappings in `docker-compose.yml`:

  ```yaml
  ports:
    - "3001:80" # Change 3000 to 3001 for client
    - "5001:8080" # Change 5000 to 5001 for API
  ```

- **Fresh start:** To completely reset the application:
  ```bash
  docker compose down
  docker volume rm flowmanager-data
  docker compose up -d
  ```

### Build and Push Docker Images

If you need to build and push your own images to Docker Hub:

1. **Build the API image:**

   ```bash
   cd FlowManager
   docker build -f Dockerfile.api -t <your_dockerhub_username>/flowmanager:api-latest .
   ```

2. **Build the Client image:**

   ```bash
   docker build -f Dockerfile.client -t <your_dockerhub_username>/flowmanager:client-latest .
   ```

3. **Login to Docker Hub:**

   ```bash
   docker login
   ```

4. **Push both images:**

   ```bash
   docker push <your_dockerhub_username>/flowmanager:api-latest
   docker push <your_dockerhub_username>/flowmanager:client-latest
   ```

5. **Update `docker-compose.yml`** to use your images:

   ```yaml
   services:
     api:
       image: <your_dockerhub_username>/flowmanager:api-latest
       container_name: flowmanager-api
       ports:
         - "5000:8080"
       volumes:
         - flowmanager-data:/app/data
       environment:
         - ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production
       restart: unless-stopped

     client:
       image: <your_dockerhub_username>/flowmanager:client-latest
       container_name: flowmanager-client
       ports:
         - "3000:80"
       environment:
         - API_URL=http://api:80
       depends_on:
         - api
       restart: unless-stopped

   volumes:
     flowmanager-data:
       driver: local
   ```

6. **Share with your team:** Others can now pull and run your images on any device using the same `docker-compose.yml` configuration.

## 🛠️ Development Instructions

1. Open the project in Visual Studio 2022+.
2. Go to **Configure Startup Project...** (right click on the solution, or from the top menu).
3. For each component project (FlowManager.API and FlowManager.Client):
   - Select **Action: Start**
   - Select **Debug Target: https**
   - Always run with **New Profile** (create a new profile for each debug session).

---

## 📝 Additional Notes

- **DB Setup:** The SQLite database file (`flowmanager.db`) is automatically created at first run.
- **Extensibility:** The modular structure allows for rapid addition of new features, integration of new services, or changing the database.
